GREENL!FE APP

The Application was inspired by the 3 Pillars of Javascript, my love for plants & teaching my 4 year old son how to indentify a happy plant vs a sad plant.
GreenL!fe is a clean, fun single page application(SPA) showcasing backend logic, AJAX requests, DOM manipulation & a has_many / belongs_to relationships between two Models.

GREENL!FE is an application that allows users to sign up, add, name, viewing and delete other users plants as well. if the plants are sad that is ðŸ¥€.

Plant consists of a "happy" button counter & sad button that fires off an Api adapter method removing the plant from the DOM.
